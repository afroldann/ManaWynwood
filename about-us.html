            <p>
			ManaWynwood started with the vision of transforming Wynwood into an international culture hub for the Americas. Within the past few years the operation has expanded to include major productions while fostering the arts community. Our focus on cultural entrepreneurship, and real estate rehabilitation for one of Miami’s most promising emerging neighborhoods, has proven to have a significant impact.
		    </p>
            <p>
			ManaWynwood has brought together key assets in the District to host major events during Art Basel, Winter Music Conference, and every month during the Wynwood Art Walk. With ideal event venues and unique properties for lease, our portfolio is stacked with over 30 acres of property in the burgeoning Arts District. The Mana Wynwood Production Village is a truly unique raw space and sound stage in the heart of the neighborhood, and has been host to productions from Iron Man 3 to Kendrick Lamar and other variety of events during Art Basel Week. We have also played host to artists from Swedish House Mafia, Trick Daddy, Ron English, and an array  of local, national, and international street artists gracing the walls of the many warehouse spaces under our control.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our vision is simple; as one of the largest land owners in the district, we see it as our responsibility to continue the renaissance started by our predecessors and peers, creating a neighborhood catered to the creative class and cultivating Miami’s future as a cultural capital for Latin America.

			<h2 class="large-12 columns">MOISHE <span>MANA</span></h2>
			<p>
			Moishe Mana is an intuitive visionary who started from humble beginnings, building an empire that spans across markets & industries. In 1983, Moishe's Moving's inception started out with one man in a single van and grew from there. By 1990, it had become the largest independent moving company in New York City. By 1995, they were the largest in the entire tri-state area. Today, they operate from regional offices across the nation with hundreds of employees.
			</p>
			<p>
			Moishe’s Moving is a NY institution with Moishe Mana owning a conglomerate of 15 companies. Over time, Mana's interests grew to develop creative communities that cater to artists, and the people supporting their work. Mana's first effort in this direction was to spearhead the development of NYC's Meatpacking District in 1995, where he opened Milk Studios. Today Milk has become a cultural hub in the worlds of fashion and media.
			</p>
			<p>
			In 2010, Moishe Mana purchased several properties in the warehouse district of Jersey City where the Mana Contemporary Art Complex now has its headquarters, artist residencies, galleries, and work studios. In addition to this, Mana Contemporary has grown into a state of the art storage facility for premier art foundations, such as the Guggenheim, MoMa, New Museum, and several notable galleries and private collections.
			</p>
			<p>
			In an attempt to develope urban environments into "creative villages,” Mana saw a promising opportunity in the Wynwood Art District of Miami. This thriving artist enclave bears some resemblance to the Meat Packing District in NYC and is now ready to become a creative mecca for the Americas. ManaWynwood encompasses over 40 buildings with over half a million combined square feet.

			<p>
			The Wynwood Art District is a unique submarket located within the center of the Biscayne corridor. It’s proximity to Midtown, the Design District, South Beach, and Downtown, make it one of the most accessible locations in Miami. Wynwood has two major sub-districts, the Wynwood Art District along NW 2nd Avenue, and the Wynwood Fashion District along NW 5th Avenue.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wynwood is also referred to as "Little San Juan", and commonly known as "El Barrio" as many Puerto Ricans began immigrating to this Miami neighborhood from the island and northeastern cities in the 1950s. Recently, however, the neighborhood has seen a push towards rehabilitation with increased investments and new developments. It is now home to art galleries & studios, retail stores, co-working spaces, entrepreneurs, tech start-ups, eclectic bars, education facilities, home grown businesses, and one of the largest open-air street-art galleries in the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking over what used to be the warehouse and manufacturing district of Miami, artists & developers have rehabilitated neglected warehouses, shuttered factories, and other unused buildings transforming them into the numerous galleries, restaurants, artists studios, cafes, bars, and residences that are seen here today.
